# GitHub Copilot Workshop: Medical Device Development

## 🩺 Course Overview

This comprehensive workshop teaches GitHub Copilot through hands-on development of a glucose monitoring system. Participants learn AI-assisted programming, debugging, testing, and collaborative development workflows in the context of safety-critical medical device software.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will master:
- **GitHub Copilot Fundamentals**: Code completion, inline chat, and agent mode
- **AI-Assisted Debugging**: Finding and fixing complex bugs with Copilot guidance
- **Professional Testing**: Unit testing and quality assurance for medical devices
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Pull requests, code review, and MCP integration
- **Custom Instructions**: Optimizing Copilot for domain-specific development

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **Prerequisites**
- GitHub account with Copilot access
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Git installed locally
- GCC compiler and Make build system
- Doxygen (optional, for documentation generation)

### **Repository Setup**

1. **Create your own repository from the template**
   - Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository" (public or private is fine)

2. **Clone the code locally**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

3. **Make sure Copilot is enabled**
   - Check the Copilot icon; if prompted, enable Copilot/Copilot Chat
   - Verify Copilot is working by seeing suggestions as you type

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <lab_1<feature>
   ```
   Example: `git checkout -b lab_1/glucose-analysis`

### **Lab Execution**
Each lab is self-contained with its own build system:

```bash
# Navigate to any lab
cd lab_1/challenge  # or lab_2/challenge, lab_3/challenge

# Build the system
make

# Run the glucose monitor
make run

# Run tests (Lab 3)
make test

# Clean build artifacts  
make clean
```
